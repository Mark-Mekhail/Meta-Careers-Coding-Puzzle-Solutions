# Stack Stabilization (Chapter 1)

## Problem Description

*Note: [Chapter 2](../../Level%203/Stack%20Stabilization%202/) is a harder version of this puzzle.*

There's a stack of $N$ inflatable discs, with the $i\text{th}$ disc from the top having an initial radius of $R_i$ inches.

The stack is considered *unstable* if it includes at least one disc whose radius is larger than or equal to that of the disc directly under it. In other words, for the stack to be *stable*, each disc must have a strictly smaller radius than that of the disc directly under it.

As long as the stack is unstable, you can repeatedly choose any disc of your choice and deflate it down to have a radius of your choice which is strictly smaller than the discâ€™s prior radius. The new radius must be a positive integer number of inches.

Determine the minimum number of discs which need to be deflated in order to make the stack stable, if this is possible at all. If it is impossible to stabilize the stack, return $-1$ instead.

## Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 50$

$1 \leq R_i \leq 1{\small,}000{\small,}000{\small,}000$

## Solution

### Function Descriptions and Implementation Approaches

#### getMinimumDeflatedDiscCount(N, R)

*Top level function for the problem.*

Go through the discs from bottom to top. If any disc is found to not be smaller than the disc below it, deflate the disc and update its radius such that $R_i = R_{i+1} - 1$. Return the number of discs deflated in this process.

### Key Insights and Optimizations

- Assuming the stack is stable below a disc $i$, disc $i$ will need to be deflated if and only if the disc below it is larger or equal in size to it. We should only deflate discs to be smaller than the disc below it by $1$ so that we avoid unnecessary deflations later on.
