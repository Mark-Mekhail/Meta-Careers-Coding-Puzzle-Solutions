# Scoreboard Inference (Chapter 2)

## Problem Description

*Note: [Chapter 1](../../Level%201/Scoreboard%20Inference%201/) is an easier version of this puzzle. The only difference is a smaller set of possible problem point values.*

You are spectating a programming contest with $N$ competitors, each trying to independently solve the same set of programming problems. Each problem has a point value, which is **either 1, 2, or 3**.

On the scoreboard, you observe that the $i\text{th}$ competitor has attained a score of $S_i$, which is a positive integer equal to the sum of the point values of all the problems they have solved.

The scoreboard does not display the number of problems in the contest, nor their point values. Using the information available, you would like to determine the minimum possible number of problems in the contest.

## Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 500{\small,}000$

$1 \leq S_i \leq 1{\small,}000{\small,}000{\small,}000$
