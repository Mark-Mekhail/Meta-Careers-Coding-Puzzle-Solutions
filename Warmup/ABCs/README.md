## Problem Description

Given three integers *A*, *B*, and *C*, determine their sum.

Your task is to implement the function getSum(A, B, C) which returns the sum *A* + *B* + *C*.

## Constraints

1 ≤ *A*,*B*,*C* ≤ 100

## Approach

The approach is trivial. All we need to do is sum up the three numbers!
